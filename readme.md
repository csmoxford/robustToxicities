# Robust Toxicities #

TODO: Write a project description

## Installation ##

1. In the R console: `devtools::install_github("finite2/robustToxicities")`. You may need to install the devtools package first

## Usage ##

See the help files

## To-do list ##

1. Remove shiny app, concentrate effort in two examples. One for each timeType, and a lyx based example.
2. Plots to output efficiently to latex, png and the screen. Might take some cues from d3 to do this. Could try to impliment a d3 solution later?
3. Tidy up help files.
4. Link the examples properly.
